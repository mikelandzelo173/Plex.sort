"""A simple script that lets you log into your Plex account and select a playlist to sort.

URL: https://github.com/mikelandzelo173/Plex.sort
Python Version: 3.7+

Disclaimer:
I'm not responsible for any data loss which might occur. There may also be bugs or unexpected behaviors.
Always use with common sense.

What does it do:
You will be prompted to log into your Plex account. After that you can select a playlist that you want to sort.
Plex lacks this feature, so I made this script. It comes in handy if you want to find duplicates in a gigantic music
playlist or just want to have everything sorted alphabetically.

Before use:
You will be guided through the whole process but to skip the initial login process every time you use the script you
might want to take a note of your authentication token and save it to the config.ini file which should be located in
~/.config/plexapi/ (which can be overridden by setting the environment variable PLEXAPI_CONFIG_PATH with the file path
you desire) or in the same directory as this script. You could also save your username and password to the config.ini
file instead.

In step 2 you will have to select a resource which is connected to your Plex account. You can only select Plex Media
Servers that host playlists. If there is only one Plex Media Server available, this step will be skipped.

After that, you must select a playlist to sort. Please note that smart playlists must not be altered and therefore are
not listed. You can also determine if you want to edit the selected playlist or create a new and sorted one based on
the playlist you just selected. You can also decide by which key and direction it should be sorted.
